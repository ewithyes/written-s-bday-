      <div style="font-size: xx-large; font-weight: bolder;">Our <span style="color:#f0ad60;">Story</span></div>
<br>Once upon a time, in a world where ordinary websites roamed, a genius had a revelation: the internet desperately needed a site that is simply awesome. Days and days have gone by, and none of the existing websites managed to appeal to the genius' refined criteria. So, on one summer day, that genius happened to purchase a Udemy course on web development and decided not to wait any longer. The genius also happened to have an awesome friend, er, we'll call her <span style="font-style: italic;">Read</span>, who had such awesome interests and taste in things, that those would make such
 a brilliant base & inspiration for the perfect website the genius had envisioned. And thus, soon after, best site ever&trade; was born, first as an idea that would fulfill the genius' peculiar expectations & forever change the trajectory of the web development industry, but later also as a product so meticulously crafted as the perfect birthday gift for this masterpiece's incredible muse - the one and only <span style="font-style: italic;">Read</span>. Oh, to hell with anonymization - (the genius hadn't purchased a course on online security, afterall) - the one and only <span style="font-style: italic; color:#f0ad60; font-weight: bolder;">Written.</span>
<div style="font-size: xx-large; font-weight: bolder;"><br>Our <span style="color:#f0ad60;">Mission?</span></div> <br>To honor the incredible person that Written is, with a site that radiates (almost) the same charm, wit, and sheer awesomeness she brings into the world every day. Also to honor the genius' impeccable mind. But the former a bit more.

<div style="font-size: xx-large; font-weight: bolder;"><br>What We Do
At <span style="color:#f0ad60;">best site ever&trade;?</span></div><br>We specialize in celebrating awesomeness. 
That's about it, really. Our team of developers works day and night to deliver only the best content that can be found - which varies from super-adorable affirmations, interesting articles, cute animal pictures, cute pictures in general, different kinds of tutorials, and life inspo in overall, all carefully hand-picked (mostly) from the gardens of Pinterest,
all the way to media recommendations, hilarious memes or fun videos (matching Written's top-notch humor, of course). The site also (plans to) offer(s) variety of practical, cutting-edge features, such as blog entries, event calendar, simple but engaging games to play when bored and lots more. The site is still in beta-testing mode (and the mastermind behind this project still hasn't gone through all 70 hours of lessons of the course), so not even our team knows exactly what'll be in store for you. But there's one thing they know - it's going to be awesome. And updated every <span style="font-weight: bolder;">26th</span> in the month.
